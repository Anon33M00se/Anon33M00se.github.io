<p>
As we make the final preparations for our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiot/floathub">Kickstarter Launch</a>, many of
the folks we’ve press-ganged into acting as beta testers have been
asking us about FloatHub’s history. Rather than dribbling out snippets
of answers here and there, we’ve attempted to set down a relatively
brief narrative of how we got here (in a technical sense).
</p>

<p>
The original impetus was a definite itch; after the umpteenth time
arriving at our boat and discovering some minor disaster related to
flat batteries, water over the floorboards, etc., etc, we thought, how
hard could it be to hack a solution to this problem? There has to be
an affordable way to monitor what’s happening on a boat when we’re not
onboard. Just solder-up some sensors to an old 2g cell phone and push
readings to a server somewhere. Flat file data storage, a few grep
scripts, some log rotations, and you’re done. Shouldn’t take more than
an afternoon. :-)
</p>

<p>
Initially, we had no intention of trying to create a commercial
product. We just wanted to solve our own problem. Maybe create a few
extra copies for friends in the same situation &#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgcd2e8bd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcd2e8bd">Hardware Choices</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcd2e8bd">
<p>
After the first few largely forgettable experimental failures, we made
some basic hardware decisions. We wanted to go with a true
microcontroller (as opposed to a more complicated Raspberry Pi or
other higher level system). The main reason was power usage, since
boats often have to make their own. But we were also attracted to a
really <span class="underline">simple</span> design goal for the device; ideally it would just sit
on a boat for months and years, with no-one ever having to intervene
and update it, install a new driver, and so on. To the extent that we
wanted to do anything clever with the data, we were pretty sure the
right idea was to do that out on the network, after it had already
been pushed off the boat. Plus there is something hard to define but
extremely satisfying about writing low-level microcontroller code; you
are in charge of just about <span class="underline">everything</span>. Working just a compiler
above bare wires with memory measured in kilobytes is such a
refreshing change from most other kinds of software development.
</p>

<p>
Since we wanted to talk to other onboard systems (depth sounders, wind
speed, etc.) and since most historic data systems on boats use a 4800
baud protocol that is a very close cousin of RS-232/RS-422, we knew
we’d want multiple serial ports. Accordingly, we settled on the
<a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware#mega-family">Arduino Mega</a> for the prototyping platform (it has 4 serial ports). We
also wanted to be able to directly measure analog voltages to be able
to report on battery levels, charging systems, and pump voltages (to
see when and for how long pumps were running). Again we stayed very
simple, and started designing a custom Arduino shield that included
straightforward voltage dividers composed of simple resistors. We also
made sure our board design passed through all header connections so
that we could stack more shields on top. Adding an embedded GPS was an
absolute breeze (just supply power and make a serial connection to any
of the plentiful GPS chipsets, e.g. the ubiquitous Neo 6 family). That
gave us not only position, but date and time info as well. We also
added a Bosch chip that measured temperature and barometric pressure.
</p>

<p>
So with an off-the-shelf Mega and a half-breadboard/half-shield
prototype, we had a basic system that could monitor 9 voltages, talk
to other onboard systems, know where it was in space &amp; time, and take
some ambient weather measurements .
</p>


<figure id="orgb218817">
<img src="./static/img/floathub_v0.0.1.png" alt="floathub_v0.0.1.png">

</figure>

<p>
In the first real working iteration of the hardware, we used a
cellular shield that interacted with the Mega on serial port 2 and
basically used a Hayes Modem command set. With that, we could
periodically do an AT-CALL {HOME} (which would get a GRPS-based TCP/IP
socket connection to a host and port) and then AT-SEND {STRING OF
DATA} to send a packet to the host.
</p>

<p>
So the next challenge was what should that {STRING OF DATA} actually
be composed of?
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org1203385" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1203385">A Protocol</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1203385">
<p>
On the server side, we could, for all intents and purposes, do
anything we wanted in terms of data types, markup, handshaking,
transmission frequency, security, encryption, and so on. The challenge
was the device side, where our little microcontroller took a
non-trivial number of clock cycles just to assemble characters into a
string. Sending them took longer still. And if the connection was
lost, we had to worry about somehow storing the data in a tiny amount
of EEPROM and trying to keep phoning home in the meantime.
</p>

<p>
As far as marking up the data, the most obvious choice was the NMEA
protocol that many marine instruments already use, and essentially all
GPS chipsets speak. This would have the advantage of making the device
really, <span class="underline">really</span> simple. It would just be a gateway that sent NMEA up
over a cellular link. The main disadvantage is that NMEA is, in this
context, idiotically verbose; a GPS chip just keeps spitting out
location data on a NMEA link at 4800 baud even if it remains entirely
motionless. And since NMEA is really a local, hard-wired serial
protocol, it has absolutely no notion of identity or security.
</p>

<p>
A second natural choice was a then emerging JSON-based standard for
onboard systems called <a href="https://signalk.org/">SignalK</a>. This had several great advantages, not
the least of which is that it is truly free and open. Unfortunately,
while trying to mark up JSON in a minuscule memory footprint is just
barely possible, it is quite difficult and very limiting in how many
pieces of data you can handle (the right place for SignalK in the
FloatHub world is as an output from the server, something we are
currently actively working on).
</p>

<p>
And so, of course, we rolled our own protocol. Details are <a href="https://www.modiot.com/FloatHubCommunicationsProtocol_0.39.pdf">available</a>,
but the gist of it is that we needed two message types, and both of
them had to be nice and compact. First, we needed a sample-in-time
type of message that showed the current state of all the systems
(battery voltages, water depth, etc.). We also needed a point-in-time
message that could be sent when an important event had just occurred
(e.g. a pump turned on at precisely 11:23:06 UTC). Then we had to have
some convention to explain which device the message was coming from
(i.e. a unique identifier). On top of all of that, we needed some form
of encryption, as otherwise we would be passing plaintext data over
TCP/IP (including location information). A full SSL-style stack of
infrastructure would have overwhelmed our little Megas, but we did
have enough spare program space to squeeze in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_.28CBC.29">AES-CBC</a> routine.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org7a6421b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7a6421b">Iterating Hardware</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a6421b">
<p>
We then spent something close to <span class="underline">3 years</span> of otherwise idle time in
the evenings and on weekends iterating on the hardware. We’re still
far from true circuit design ninjas, but gradually progressed from
thru-hole, hand soldered components to mostly surface mount. All of
the layout and design was done in Eagle. We tried a few different
places for printed circuit board (PCB) prototype manufacturing, but
eventually settled on <a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/">Seeed</a> as they could do both the PCB creation and
<a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">component assembly</a> in very small batches at reasonable rates.
</p>


<figure id="org4096b37">
<img src="./static/img/floathub_p3a3.png" alt="floathub_p3a3.png">

</figure>

<p>
While our custom shield progressed, we used a few different Arduino
WiFi and Cellular shields on the top of the physical stack for
communications. We needed an enclosure that could encompass this
triple-stacked PCB sandwich, have a cutout where the screw terminals
would allow hookups for voltage testing, mounting points for GPS,
WiFi, and Cellular antennas, and so on. We did spend a fair bit of
time hunting for a ready-made case we could use off the shelf, but
never found one that really worked.
</p>

<p>
So, just to ratchet up the time commitment to this “easy hack”
solution, we started fiddling with CAD/CAM software. We knew we could
3-D print a case if we could manage to wrap our brains around modeling
software. We started out with <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>, which we absolutely
loved. It’s really more of a programming language than a traditional
GUI-based CAD/CAM tool, so we were able to keep thinking like software
developers when using it. Data and directives are in the “source code”
(e.g. draw a box here, take away the volume of a cylinder there),
which is then run through a “compiler” (i.e. OpenSCAD), to create
“object” (i.e. files that can be sent to a 3-D printer). We acquired a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printrbot">Printrbot</a> simple and started churning out enclosure revisions. As our
volume of prototype units went up, we initially printed them with
<a href="https://www.shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>, although recently have been doing more and more with <a href="https://www.voodoomfg.com/">Voodoo
Manufacturing</a>.
</p>


<figure id="org90aa58c">
<img src="./static/img/floathub_p4p5.png" alt="floathub_p4p5.png">

</figure>

<p>
At some point in 2015, we had really settled on the physical design
and thought we were “done” from an enclosure standpoint. Still only
half serious about ever moving forward with a real commercial product,
we started reading about injection molding. We’d naively assumed that
any file that could be 3-D printed would also be just fine for tooling
molds. Couple of problems with that: 1) at the time, OpenSCAD was not
great with the IGES or STEP files used by most tooling systems, and 2)
a little something called “draft”. We designed our enclosure with
simple right angles just about everywhere. Turns out that does not
work very well for parts that will come out of a mold. You need angles
that taper (at least a little) so the part can be popped out after
it’s cooled. This notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(engineering)">draft</a>  is probably taught in the first
month of any CAD/CAM or engineering course, but it was news to
us. Since we were already having format issues with OpenSCAD and we
were going to have to redesign the whole enclosure anyway, we switched
to FreeCAD for our CAD/CAM work. After more months of spare hours
learning the tool and then using it to re-design the case, we finally
had something that the automated design checker at <a href="https://www.protolabs.com/">ProtoLabs</a> said
could be injected molded without too much difficulty.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2057f35" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2057f35">A Server Process</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2057f35">
<p>
With the device electronics and physical specification coming along
nicely, we turned back to the server side of our home grown data
protocol. This was a nice project that had a very well defined scope:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>listen for an incoming connection</li>
<li>receive a string of characters from the device, terminated by a newline</li>
<li>acknowledge reception by sending a short response string (and generally closing the connection)</li>
<li>given the unique identifier in the initial part of the string, attempt to decrypt it (AES-CBC)</li>
<li>On successful decryption, parse out data elements and stuff them into permanent storage (a database)</li>
</ol>

<p>
We basically used a Python TCPSocketServer with a threading mixin,
running on some fairly small AWS EC2 instances. Each job is very
discreet. When the string arrives, there’s a defined section near the
beginning that includes a unique identifier. Looking this up in a
server side database, we grab the relevant AES key for that “account”
(the device’s unique identifier) and attempt decryption. If that
succeeds, then we have plaintext data to parse out of the string and
store in the relevant table(s) for this “account”.
</p>

<p>
The only thing we did here which even verged on clever was to realize
that the streaming data for each “account” could be stored in its own
tablespace (no device data is directly reliant on any other device’s
data). We could use a central database to look up “account”
information and include in that a pointer to device-specific
host/database/tables where message data could be stored. Although each
transmission from the device is quite small, they can send up to 120
per hour, and over the days, weeks, and months, the set can grow to
multiple GBs per device. Having the data sharded in this way makes it
cleaner to work with. For example, deleting an “account” is just a
simple table drop, not a careful select on some enormous über-table of
data. And we can scale in a relatively straightforward way by just
horizontally adding more database instances.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0330e31" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0330e31">The Amazing ESP8266</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0330e31">
<p>
Somewhere in 2015, we noticed that we were starting to use the word
“account” a lot, implying that we really had started to think of this
as something we might try to sell commercially. The biggest remaining
technical barrier was then device configuration. Up until that point,
we had been making changes in device identifiers, AES keys, network
settings, and other parameters largely by editing source code,
recompiling, and then re-flashing the Mega. Perfectly adequate for
proving out the core functionality, but far from viable as a “user
experience”. We experimented a little bit with a very simple serial
protocol where you could set parameters via a terminal program, but
even that was not terribly user friendly. We also experimented with
bluetooth and an app, where we could hide the serial line protocol
behind a phone/tablet GUI.
</p>


<figure id="org8d9b34a">
<img src="./static/img/esp8266.png" alt="esp8266.png">

</figure>

<p>
Around the same time, everyone and their uncle started writing about a
new WiFi-centric microcontroller called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266">ESP8266</a>. This chip has a
whole TCP/IP stack onboard, can do both access point and regular
station mode (and even both at the same time), was quickly supported
within the <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino">Arduino environment</a>, and is ridiculously cheap (less than
$10, even in a full breakout-board configuration). We started
experimenting and realized we could add one to FloatHub and have it
serve two roles: 1) replace shield-based WiFi solutions for sending
date off the device, and 2) run a minuscule web-server right onboard
that would let end users set configuration values.
</p>

<p>
Compared to the modern web development world of complex application
server stacks and API’s to API’s, writing a whole
microcontroller-based http server is starkly clear cut. Much like our
previous code for the Mega, you’re dealing with tiny executable sizes,
and pretty severe memory limitations. For example, we needed cookies
for our device logon, so we had to actually come up with a
small-as-possible C struct to represent them. Graphic elements in the
interface had to be byte-coded into the executable, as there is no
traditional file system to serve them from.
</p>

<p>
The ESP8266 is also <span class="underline">rock</span> solid as an upstream data channel. As long
as it can see it’s designated WiFi connection, it will stay connected,
and the interactions over loosing a connection and then asking it to
re-establish one are very straightforward and reliable. The fact that
it can do Access Point and regular Station mode at the same time means
FloatHub effectively has two WiFi interfaces; a “private” one with
it’s own 192.168.4.* address space, and a “public” one where it
connects with the outside world. Our only grumble is that since these
two modes share the actual same physical hardware, they have to be at
the same WiFi frequency. So if the upstream connection has to move to
a new frequency to connect, it must drag along the private connection
to that new frequency as well, effectively bumping off clients and
forcing them to re-connect. But it’s a very small price to pay, and a
joy to be able to fiddle with device settings with any browser that
happens to be handy.
</p>

<p>
Since we needed the ESP8266 on all FloatHub devices (even the cellular
version) in order to do device configuration, we realized we should
also add an option to broadcast NMEA over WiFi. That is, have a little
server process in parallel with the http server that would push NMEA
data to any connected client. This is really a NMEA to WiFi gateway,
pushing any valid data generated internally by the onboard sensors or
seen coming in from other devices (via serial). There are lots of
marine applications for phones, tablets, and computers that can make a
connection to these sorts of servers and then display vessel location,
depth, wind speed, etc. Originally this was an almost accidental
by-product of the fact that we needed some way to easily configure a
FloatHub. Now it is easily the favorite feature among our beta
testers.

The last major piece of the, “is this actually something we could
sell?” question was to make a <a href="https://floathub.com/demo">functioning website</a> with an interface to
the data. We’re really more server side developers than front-end
types, but where there’s a will, there’s a way.
</p>


<figure id="orgb1241ba">
<a href="https://floathub.com/demo"><img src="./static/img/floathub_chart.png" alt="floathub_chart.png"></a>

<p>
Our core framework is <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>, which we run with <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a>. <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> is the
public facing web server (and handles https with letsencrypt
certificates). Our Flask-based user accounts, e-mail based
verification, etc. is all fairly vanilla stuff. We set up <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for
payments and subscriptions. There is a main user account databases on
an RDS instance, and then the flow of device data is pulled in
according to the shard setup we mentioned earlier.
</p>

<p>
The actual vessel monitoring interface is a simple “one page
application”, in that it shows a bunch of data and updates
automatically as new data becomes available. Nothing really novel in
how we implement that; we use a JQuery <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/">getJSON()</a> approach to call the
data API every 30 seconds and see if new data has arrived. If it has,
we update the gauges and displays accordingly. You’d <span class="underline">never</span> want to
use it to actually navigate with, but for a quick summary of what’s up
with your boat or for following along with a vessel on a voyage, it’s
quite serviceable.
</p>

<p>
For the gauges, we looked at a fair number of different
packages. There are a <span class="underline">lot</span> of them out there. We settled on <a href="https://canvas-gauges.com/">Canvas
Gauges</a> by Mikhail Stadnyk, because it has wide browser support, is
under active development, and works as advertised. We haven’t really
done full justice to what’s possible with Canvas Gauges yet, and plan
to add more detail and nicer polish over time.

To display historical data (and update it live), we went with <a href="https://c3js.org/">C3</a>
(based, in turn, on <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>). C3 makes it dead easy to create attractive,
interactive charts. Because it’s D3-based, there’s a fairly rich set
of code to draw on, including JSON methods where you can just ask for
some data from the API and the code will automatically draw the
relevant graph once the data comes back. There are some great examples
of this and many other features of C3 in the <a href="https://c3js.org/gettingstarted.html">documentation</a>.

That pretty much sums it up. Of course we’ve skipped over lots of
detail, but we’ve covered the major items in getting from there to
here. At the time of putting these thoughts and notes together, we
have just a few days left before our KickStarter launch. We’re
optimistic, as we think FloatHub is a really useful product and
service and our beta testing group has been giving reasonably positive
feedback. But whether FloatHub enjoys successful adoption or sinks
into insignificance, it seemed like the right time to try and get some
of this history down.
</p>

<p>
From that one little itch, we got to spend time exploring circuit
layout, microcontrollers, protocol design, WiFi chipsets, embedded
servers, CAD/CAM modeling, injection molding (draft!), component
sourcing, database design, server processes, Flask, front-end
libraries, JavaScript/JQuery, and responsive data interfaces.
