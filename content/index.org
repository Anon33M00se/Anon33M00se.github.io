# Overview
# 
# This is an example of a _website_ written in *Org Mode*. If this text is longer in some way, then the left justification stuff will work better.
# 
# I wonder what happens with LaTex Math: $y=x^2$
# 
# If I want to do some raw html, how about @@html:<b>@@bold text@@html:</b>@@?

# And here is an edit. And here is another edit. And here is a third edit. And now a fourth.

# And here is some slighly more complicated math:
# 
# \begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
# x=\sqrt{b}                              % even tables, figures, etc
# \end{equation}
# 
# \begin{equation}                        % arbitrary environments,
# x=\frac{dy}{dx}                              % even tables, figures, etc
# \end{equation}
# 
# If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
# either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
