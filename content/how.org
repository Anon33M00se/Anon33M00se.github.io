* How does this site work?

A few people have asked me about how I manage this site. It changes
frequently, as I will often throw stuff up very quickly, move it
around, and take it down again.

The whole site is managed by editing local files in emacs and then a
couple of quick keystrokes push out any changes to a free webhosting
github. I'll explain each of the pieces in turn.

* It Starts with Org Mode

Org mode is a part of Emacs, and is a whole ecosystem for, well,
organizing information. [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] files are just plain text with some
formatting conventions not unlike [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][Markdown]]. Here's an example: 

#+BEGIN_SRC code
