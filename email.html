I have roughly two dozen email addresses that I need to be able to
send and receive from on a (somewhat) regular basis. I also like
vastly prefer have a local email client with a complete archive of all
my emails on any laptop or desktop system that I use regularly. There
are a whole host of reasons for these prefereces, not the least of
which is being able to search and process emails when I have spotty (or
zero) internet access.

For many years I used Thunderbird, as it was reasonably fast, had good
search, and supported interacting with Microsoft
Outlook/Exchange/Office365/OWA servers (which I need for a couple of
corporate email addresses). The Microsoft bit was handled by <a href="https://www.beonex.com/owl/">OWL by
Beonex</a>, which is a great little piece of software. But I had a few issues with this setup:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Thunderbird search started to get very unreliable for me across 3 or 4 different machines I had it installed on.</li>

<li>The non-open source license fee I was paying for OWL was bothering me more and more as the only non-OS piece of software I used on any regular basis.</li>

<li>I was spending more and more of my day in Emacs for just about everything else, so it was starting to feel creaky to be switching virtual desktops and reaching for the mouse evert time I needed to handle some email.</li>
</ol>




<p>
So search is really important, as is
