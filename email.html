<h2 id="org0ae30a5">Handling email in Emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ae30a5">
<p>
I have roughly two dozen email addresses that I need to be able to
send and receive from on a regular basis. I also vastly prefer using a
local email client with a complete archive of all my email
history. There are a whole host of reasons for these preferences, not
the least of which is being able to search and process emails when I
have limited internet access.
</p>

<p>
For many years I used Thunderbird, as it was reasonably fast, had good
search, and supported interacting with Microsoft
Outlook/Exchange/Office365/OWA servers (which I need for a couple of
corporate email addresses). The Exchange bit was handled by <a href="https://www.beonex.com/owl/">OWL</a>, which
is a great little piece of software. But I had a few issues with this
setup:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Thunderbird search started to get very unreliable for me across 3 or 4 different machines.</li>

<li>The OWL plugin was the only non-open source piece of software I used on any regular basis.</li>

<li>Since I spend so much time in Emacs, it was jarring to be switching virtual desktops and reaching for the mouse every time I needed to handle some email.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So I set out on a quest to handle all my email requirements from
inside Emacs. What follows is both long and incomplete. It's long
because I discuss almost all of the setup and extensions I use on a
daily basis. It's incomplete because I don't go into exhaustive
minutiae on every configuration issue or option. But there are links
to further details where relevant, and there are some resources listed
at the end for even more help.

<div id="outline-container-orgf329a0f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf329a0f">Local mailbox syncing with mbsync</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf329a0f">
<p>
Before we can read and respond to emails inside Emacs, we first need a
mechanism to sync email over IMAP. There are a few alternatives out
there such as <a href="https://www.offlineimap.org/">offlineimap</a>, but the general consensus for new users
seems to be to use mbsync. It has a slightly confusing project name
(isync/mbsync), and there is a github repository that appears in
searches (<a href="https://github.com/gburd/isync">https://github.com/gburd/isync</a>), but the actual current
location for the project is on SourceForge at
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/isync/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/isync/</a>. For most Linux distributions
and Mac OS X, you'll probably just install a package, but the source
code is available and straightforward to compile if you need to.
</p>

<p>
You'll need an <b>~/.mbsync</b> file in your home directory that defines each
of your email accounts. Each account entry will look something like
this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">IMAPAccount MyShortNameForThisAccount
Host imap.email-host.com
User foo@example.com
Port 993
PassCmd "pass foo@example.com"
TLSType IMAPS
AuthMechs PLAIN
PipelineDepth 1
CertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

IMAPStore foo@example.com-remote
Account MyShortNameForThisAccount

MaildirStore foo@example.com-local
Subfolders Verbatim
Path ~/Mail/MyShortNameForThisAccount/
Inbox ~/Mail/MyShortNameForThisAccoun/Inbox

Channel foo@example.com
Far :foo@example.com-remote:
Near :foo@example.com-local:
Patterns *
Create Near
Sync All
SyncState *

</pre>
</div>


<p>
Most of this is pretty self explanatory, and there is an excellent <a href="https://isync.sourceforge.io/mbsync.html">man
page</a> that explains how to configure things. One issue to highlight is
that each IMAP mail account has an entry for "AuthMechs"
(<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml">authentication mechanisms</a>). Many accounts will use "PLAIN", but in
the case of nasty Microsoft Exchange servers, you'll probably use
"XOAUTH2" (see below).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga623865" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga623865">Authenticating with pass and pizauth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga623865">
<p>
I use "<a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">password-store</a>" (sometimes called "gnu pass") with Yubikey
hardware keys for all my passwords, secrets, ssh credentials, and
whatnot (see <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide">here</a> for a pretty comprehensive resource on setting that
up). So in my <b>~/.mbsync</b> configuration for each of my "normal" imap
accounts I have a line line this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">PassCmd "pass foo@example.com"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Meaning that each time mbsync wants to go and retrieve emails for this
account, it will run the <b>pass</b> command to get the password required
for that account.
</p>

<p>
In the case of Exchange servers, however, the "PassCmd" setting I use
is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">PassCmd "pizauth show bar"
</pre>
</div>


<p>
This uses a utility called pizauth to manage OAUTH2 tokens (the github
repository is <a href="https://github.com/ltratt/pizauth">here</a>). You will probably need to compile this from
scratch, which means you will need to have a rust compiler
available. A good resource on how to do that is available at <a href="https://brettpresnell.com/post/email/">this
website</a> (scroll down to "Setting Up pizauth" for pizauth specifics,
but the whole guide is relevant).
</p>

<p>
You'll then have to setup a <b>~/.config/pizauth.conf</b> that will look something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">account "officesmtp" {
    auth_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize";
    token_uri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token";
    client_id = "..."; // Fill in with your Client ID
    client_secret = "..."; // Fill in with your Client secret
    scopes = [
      "https://outlook.office365.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All",
      "https://outlook.office365.com/SMTP.Send",
      "offline_access"
    ];
    // You don't have to specify login_hint, but it does make authentication a
    // little easier.
    auth_uri_fields = { "login_hint": "email@example.com" };
}
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Invoke the pizauth server (by running <b>pizauth server</b>), and then try
to get your first oath2 credentials by entering <b>pizauth show
officesmtp</b> (where <b>officesmtp</b> is whatever you call the account in
your <b>.config/pizauth.conf</b> file). The first time you run the <b>show</b>
command, it will open a browser tab and have you do an oauth2 login
with the exchange server. Subsequent invocations will work without
browser interaction for as long as the oauth server allows the same
token (or chain of refreshed tokens) to remain valid.
</p>

<p>
Once pizauth is in place, you can test if all email retrieval is
working by running:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">mbsync -a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
on the command line. That should go and sync with all the accounts
defined in your <b>~/.mbsync</b> file, and print progress messages as it
goes. If something doesn't work, you can just delete all or some of
the mail directories that mbsync fills (anything missing will be
refilled on the next invocation of mbsync).
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org3be8cb4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3be8cb4">Indexing your local mail with mu</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3be8cb4">
<p>
Having sync'd all your email locally, the next step is to start
indexing it. This will allow you to perform quick searches across all
your email accounts. There are packages for an amazing indexer called
mu (which is really part of mu4e, see below). In Ubuntu, it's <b>apt
install maildir-utils</b>. or you can build the most recent version from
<a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu">https://github.com/djcb/mu</a>.
</p>

<p>
Either way, once installed you run
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">mu init --maildir=/home/username/Mail             \
        --my-address=foo@example-one.com          \
        --my-address=bar@example-two.com          
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to configure mu for your email location and to let it know which email
address(es) belong to you. You can run <b>mu info</b> to check on the
configuration, and them <b>mu init</b> to actually index everything. If you
have a lot of email, this can take several minutes (or even longer
&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Don't be afraid to experiment a bit with mu. You can always completely
nuke the index (it's probably stored in <b>~/.cache/mu/xapian/</b>) and/or
reinitialize mu by running the init command again.
</p>

<h2 id="org3563b9c">Sending emails</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3563b9c">
<p>
Before we finally get to actually accessing emails in Emacs, we also
need a way to send mail. Thankfully, this is not complicated. A quick
<b>apt install msmtp</b> will get things started. You'll then need a
<b>~/.msmtprc</b> with an entry for each account:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code"># The SMTP server of your ISP
account isp
host mail.isp.example
from smithjoe@isp.example
auth on
user 12345
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Just like we set up for incoming email, you can use OATH2 settings
with msmtp to configure it to work with those nasty Exchange servers
something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code"># An Exchange server
account      nastyexchange
auth         xoauth2
host         smtp.office365.com

tls_starttls on
from         foo@example.com
user         foo@example.com
passwordeval pizauth show bar
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To see if you've got it working, you can test it with (replace
<b>you@gmail.com</b> with a working email address you have access to):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">printf "Subject:Test\n\nThis is a test." |  msmtp -a nastyexchange you@gmail.com

<p>
Phew, there's a lot going on there, and there are a lot of other
optional things not shown in the interests of clarity. The main things
to notice is that for each email account, you need to set up a mu4e
"context". There's only one shown in the example above (for
"A. User"), but you'll need one for each account. The file then
defines a shortcut to jump to that context in the mu4e
interface. Finally, configuring mu4e for outgoing email is much
simpler (you just tell it to use mstmp and set a few options).
</p>

<p>
To actually invoke mu4e from within Emacs, you just do a <b>M-x mu4e</b>,
whereupon mu4e will ask you to choose a context (as defined above) and
then display its interface:
</p>


<figure id="org50ff62f">
<img src="./static/img/mu4e_regular.png" alt="mu4e_regular.png">

</figure>

<p>
which, because it's Emacs, can be fancied up and customized to your
heart's content:
</p>


<figure id="orgca7e4dd">
<a href="https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard"><img src="./static/img/mu4e_fancy.png" alt="mu4e_fancy.png"></a>

</figure>

<p>
There are a lot of keybindings and options here, best experienced
interactively. There's a complete help system and manual built into
mu4e, all accessible from inside the interface.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org7726221" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7726221">Capturing from mu4e into org files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7726221">
<p>
Once you get comfortable with the mu4e interface, you'll discover that
it is both powerful and fast. You can jump around mail boxes easily,
and search is positively blazing.
</p>

<p>
But you can take the nimbleness of mu4e to the next level by combining
it with <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>. If you don't know what Org-mode is, you can find a
gentle introduction <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html">here</a>. Mu4e and org-mode can be combined by adding
this to the mu4e section of your <b>~/.emacs.d/init.el</b>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">mu4e-org</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and by setting up one or more "capture templates" in the same
file. Capture templates look something like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span class="org-string">"e"</span> <span class="org-string">"Email Workflow"</span>)
  (<span class="org-string">"eh"</span> <span class="org-string">"Home TODO"</span> entry
   (file+headline <span class="org-string">"Home.org"</span> <span class="org-string">"Captured Email TODOs"</span>)
   <span class="org-string">"* TODO Follow up with %:fromname on %a\n%t"</span>)
 ...
</pre>
</div>


<p>
This means the keystrokes <b>e h</b> while in capture will open your
<b>Home.org</b> file and create a <b>TODO</b> under the section heading of
"Captured Email TODOs". That TODO will include the name of the email's
sender (<b>%:fromname</b>) and the subject line of the email (<b>%a</b>). That
subject line will link back to the email itself. There will also be a
datestamp which can be easily modified. You then hit a quick <b>C-c C-c</b>
to save the item, and you are right back to reviewing emails.
</p>

<p>
This may sound complicated and it may not be immediately clear what
the benefit is. Imagine you are flying through your emails and come
across something that you must act on, but cannot do so right
now. What do you do with that email?  You could set it back to unread,
but that state of "not read" does not really represent what you want
to do with the pending action.
</p>


<p>
In a traditional email client, you could jump to the agenda or
calendar interface and set a reminder, todo, or similarly dated
entry. But then a week later when the reminder goes off, you have to
search back through your emails to get to whatever message it was that
initiated the chain of events (to be fair, Outlook does have a Message
\(\rightarrow\) Follow Up \(\rightarrow\) Add Reminder, but it is a fairly
clunky mouse driven interaction).
</p>

<p>
What you really want is a lightning fast way to create an agenda or
TODO item with minimal distraction. That's exactly what <b>mu4e-org</b> and
capture templates allow. While reading the email, with a couple of
keystrokes you immediately have a TODO entry in the relevant org file
with a timestamp <i>and a link back to the exact email that needs to be
acted on</i>. So when you are reviewing your agenda and TODO entries in
the future, you can act on the item in question and instantly pop back
into the email in question.

<h2 id="orga70de1d">Adding in Snippets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga70de1d">
<p>
If you answer a lot of emails with similar content, it can get very
annoying to find yourself typing the same sentences over and over
again. Boilerplate language like, "<i>Thanks for your interest, and
please let us know if you have any questions</i>" can be maddening to
type over and over again.
</p>

<p>
One solution is <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet">YASnippets</a>. This is an Emacs package that lets you
define short character sets that can be automatically expanded into
arbitrary text. To continue with our boilerplate example, if you
create a file like this is your "snippets directory":
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code"># -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: boilerplate-thanks
# key: &lt;bt
# --

  Thanks for your interest, and please let us know if you have any questions.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
then anytime you are composing an email you can type:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">&lt;bt
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and hit the TAB key to expand that entry into the boilerplate language
from the file. And this is just scratching the surface of what
YASnippets can do. There are facilities for accessing and handling all
kinds of data when snippets are invoked. You can even embed arbitrary
code in the invocation process to do really complicated
expansions. Comprehensive documentation is <a href="https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/">here</a>.

<h2 id="org41908d8">Fancier HTML emails</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org41908d8">

Everything we've covered so far really only involves plaintext
emails. To be sure, you can add all manner of attachments to emails in
mu4e, but if you want inline images, styled text, etc., you'll need to
move to html emails.
</p>

<p>
The answer, of course, is more org mode (isn't it always). More
precisely, with a package called <a href="https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime">org-mime</a>, the command <b>M-x
org-mime-edit-mail-in-org-mode</b> (which I bind to <b>M-o o</b>) will open a
buffer that lets you use org mode to compose as email. So font
styling, inline images, tables, etc. can all be created just like you
can do in any other org document.
</p>

<p>
So editing a buffer that looks like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-code">
*bold*, _underline_, +strikethrough+, /italics/

| n | n^2 | n^3 |
|---+-----+-----|
| 1 |   1 |   1 |
| 2 |   4 |   8 |
| 3 |   9 |  27 |

$y=x^2$

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Will produce an email that looks like this (just remember to run <b>M-x
org-mime-htmlize</b> before sending):
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<b>bold</b>, <span class="underline">underline</span>, <del>strikethrough</del>, <i>italics</i>
</p>

<table>


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-right">

<col  class="org-right">

<col  class="org-right">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">n</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">n<sup>2</sup></th>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">n<sup>3</sup></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
<td class="org-right">1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">2</td>
<td class="org-right">4</td>
<td class="org-right">8</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-right">3</td>
<td class="org-right">9</td>
<td class="org-right">27</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
\(y=x^2\)
</p>

<hr>

<p>
You can also embed inline images using the standard org mode
procedures for inline images. If you want easy drag and drop right
into your buffer, there's a package called <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download">org-download</a> that will
take care of that.
</p>

<p>
I have also heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg">org-msg</a> as an alternative to
org-mime. It is supposed to handle Outlook conventions on replies and
quoting within html emails quite well.
