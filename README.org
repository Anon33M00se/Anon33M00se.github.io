* Stuff

  Partly a place to put "stuff", partly a place to experiment with CI/CD/GitHubActions.

* How this works

  Steps to create and/or push the website
  
  - You make changes (mostly to org mode files) in ./content
  - You run ./build.sh which call emacs in script mode to run the build-site.el file
  - Content gets exported into a directory called ./public
